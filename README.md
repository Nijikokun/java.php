java.php
=========

Java Objects ported to PHP, as well as specific methods / functions.

Why?
-----------

Essentially the entire reason is because I can, however there are a lot of reasons behind this.
 
A few pertain to how PHP doesn't follow any standards regarding function naming, and that is only the tip of the iceberg.

So instead of arguing, I'm simply going to do / prove that it is possible.

Licensing
